2. [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/) usage for tracking users account details and orders.
3. [Firebase Notifications](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/) for informing couriers about new orders and clients about delivery status ([Firebase Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/)).
4. Simple e-mail sending function for finished orders (to a defined e-mail address).

## Installation
After importing/copying files you need to connect to your [Firebase project](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup) and add [Google API key for Maps/Places](https://developers.google.com/places/) (it is referenced in source code as 'google_maps_key' string).
If planning on using this project make sure to change 'PriceList.java' class, since it has really raw implementation.
## Usage
Source code is described in detail on [doksaprosta](http://doksaprosta.wordpress.com) blog. If there's a part that is not currently covered, send me a message or an [email](mailto:tryoutsapps@gmail.com).
## Disclaimer
The code was written mainly in MVP pattern though probably not in the perfect way (first time using any sort of architectural pattern :)). 

The condition I was trying to satisfy was to isolate Activity/Fragment code from data manipulation and for Presenters to be left without any Android imports.

Code's quality surely could be better. Even when I'm writing this Readme I can see dozen of places where I could code differently. 

### What isn't there
Exceptions aren't handled properly in several cases, activities and fragments' lifecycles aren't always properly taken care of, margins and other UI things were pretty much ignored, etc. If time will allow, I'll update the code. I was just trying to show that even without solid coding experience you can actually implement some sort of back-end to your Android applications.
